   - If target_folder doesn't exist, skip to Step 1
   - If target_folder is empty, skip to Step 1
   - Otherwise, proceed with existing project analysis

2. **Analyze Target Directory** (only if contains meaningful files):
   - Scan target_folder for existing project files
   - Identify configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
   - Map directory structure and organization patterns
   - Detect build systems, frameworks, and development tools

3. **Analyze Current Codebase**:
   - Identify programming languages and versions used
   - Map existing components and modules

   - Map existing workflows and development patterns
   - **CRITICAL**: Internal context ONLY - NEVER save to files, keep in memory for simulation only

### Step 1: Input Validation & Project Analysis
1. Validate input files exist and are readable
2. Parse the input plan file to extract project characteristics, technical requirements, and business context
3. Extract input arguments:
4. **$1**: plan_file_path (path to requirements/project specification file)
5. **$2**: target_folder (optional - folder to analyze for existing implementation)
6. Note any specific constraints or requirements
7. **Integrate with Step 0 findings**: Combine existing project analysis with new requirements


### Step 2: Internal Expert Simulation & Consensus Building

#### Expert Persona Generation
Generate expert personas: 4 static core experts + 7 dynamic domain experts (total 11 experts):

**Static Core Experts** (selalu aktif untuk semua project):
- **Performance CPU Expert**: CPU optimization, threading, computational efficiency, algorithmic complexity, processor utilization patterns
